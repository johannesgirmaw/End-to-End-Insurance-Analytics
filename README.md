I will provide the README for the project setup.

## Project Setup: Your Guide to Getting Started

This section of the `README.md` details the steps required to set up your local development environment for the AlphaCare Insurance Solutions project. Following these instructions will ensure you have all the necessary tools and dependencies to run the provided analysis scripts and notebooks.

### 1. System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher is recommended. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Clone the Repository

First, you need to get a copy of the project files onto your local machine.

1. **Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.**
2. **Navigate to your desired directory** where you want to store the project.

   **Bash**

   ```
   cd path/to/your/development/folder
   ```

3. **Clone the repository** using Git. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

   **Bash**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/johannesgirmaw/End-to-End-Insurance-Analytics
   ```

4. **Navigate into the cloned project directory:**

   **Bash**

   ```
   cd End-to-End-Insurance-Analytics # Or whatever your repository's name is
   ```

### 3. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended)

Using a virtual environment is crucial for managing project dependencies and avoiding conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

   **Bash**

   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

   (On some systems, you might need to use `python` instead of `python3`.)

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   \*\*
   \*\*
   ** \*** **On macOS/Linux:**
   **Bash**

   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   - **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
     **Bash**

     ```
     .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

   - **On Windows (PowerShell):**
     **PowerShell**

     ```
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

   You'll know the virtual environment is active when you see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

### 4. Install Project Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install all the necessary Python libraries using `pip`. It's good practice to ensure `pip` itself is up to date first.

**Bash**

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pyarrow jupyterlab
```

- `<span class="citation-7">pandas</span>`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `<span class="citation-7">numpy</span>`: For numerical operations.
- `<span class="citation-7">matplotlib</span>`: For basic plotting.
- `<span class="citation-7">seaborn</span>`: For advanced statistical^1^ data visualization.
- `pyarrow`: **Crucial** for efficient reading and writing of Parquet files, which are used for processed data.
- `jupyterlab`: For interactive data analysis and running the `.ipynb` notebooks.

### 5. Place the Data File

The raw historical insurance claim data (`ml.txt`) needs to be in a specific location for the `data_ingestion.py` script to find it.

1. **Create a `data` directory** inside your project's root folder if it doesn't already exist:

   **Bash**

   ```
   mkdir data
   ```

2. **Place your `ml.txt` file** inside this newly created `data` directory.
   Your project structure should now look something like this:

   ```
   your_project_root/
   ├── .venv/                   # Your virtual environment folder
   ├── data/
   │   └── ml.txt               # <--- YOUR RAW DATA FILE GOES HERE
   ├── data_ingestion.py
   ├── eda_and_stats.ipynb
   └── README.md
   ```

### 6. Run the Data Ingestion Script

This script performs initial data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing, saving a clean version in Parquet format for faster subsequent access.

1. **Ensure your virtual environment is activated** (check for `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt).
2. **Run the script from the project root directory:**
   **Bash**

   ```
   python data_ingestion.py
   ```

   - This script will print messages indicating its progress (loading, preprocessing, saving).
   - Upon successful completion, a file named `processed_ml_data.parquet` will be created in the `data/` directory.
